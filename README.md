## Summary of project

This react app project was built from scratch by me. Utlimately it took me about 40hr-60hrs of work. Communicating back and forth on the what he wanted the lay. out to be as well as getting him to send me video and gallery content. 

As we were developing it,  we came across hosting issues and since he already bought the domain from godaddy.com we decided to pin this hard coded react app and use one of the prebuilt template websites. This way he also had control on customizing his website when he felt like it. I still initially set up the website for him, since I had already built out one from scratch i had a good idea of what to build and it was uploaded with in a few hours. The perks of using prebuilt templates allow some hidden features mostly dealing with images. That kept them clean, easy to zoom and adust to the window screen size. 

## Basic functionality
This app was built as a front end app just to disaply content and info. Use state to display the content along with switch pages. There is no backend as that would require much more extensive work and cost more. Simple javascript was excuted with no serious problems, the only real frustrating part was dealing with the media and keeping the pixels clear with out disrupting the normal flow.
